as someone who has worked with many museums , i was eager to visit this gallery on my most recent trip to las vegas .
i am actually horrified this place is still in business . my 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $ 7 kids cut signs got me in the door .
oh happy day , finally have a canes near my casa .
really good place with simple decor , amazing food and great hospitality . very impressed with the lunch portion . although service took little extra time but i have no complaints since they are quite new in business .
i have been here twice . very nice and laid back . i tried the weekend southern menu and it was delicious ! collard greens , mac & cheese , ribs , bbq chicken sandwich .
we purchased new office furniture from this location . we were advised the shipment would arrive in 3 business days . the shipment was delivered the same day as promised .
everything that my husband and i tried today was amazing . i am glad i got to try something different of what i normally would because i was really pleasantly surprised .
if i could give less than one star , that would have been my choice . i rent a home and per my lease agreement it is my responsibility to pay their pool service company .
as the previous person posted , what more can really be said about this restaurant . i just came back from vegas this morning and a truly truly horrible experience .
always a fun outing to come for great hot dogs and all the fixings ! a great place to bring out of town company for a good lunch a new experience .
