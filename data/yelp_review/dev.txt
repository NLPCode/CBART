really , really happy with brendan and the team at nerd power . we shopped around a handful of solar companies , but they stuck out as the right fit for us .
this place is very new and nice ! they are still working out the bugs , . had to ask for utensils . food was great , but expected more on the hash browns side .
not much else to say but they are on point every time i come . favorite dishes , any of the beef & barbecue is a winner . the salmon is always perfect !
i have been to many thai massage places and this place is one of the best in usa ! the therapists are knowledgeable and professional .
turkey bacon and pancakes very good . french toast and hash brown casserole good .
this is one of my favorite places in town for authentic mexican food . the tacos are made fresh and every one that i have eaten is so good .
jim was very pleasant over the phone and text and got me pricing very quickly which i really appreciated .
this was my first time hiring someone to help with my parties and i will never go back to doing it alone . we did two parties close in time , a beer tasting party and a holiday party .
horrible , they have a website with a great variety of items and fair prices .
what a great spot to have breakfast . fast service very nice people , friendly .
